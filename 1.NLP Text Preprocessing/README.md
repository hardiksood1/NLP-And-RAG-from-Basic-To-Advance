# NLP Text Preprocessing

This project demonstrates basic NLP text preprocessing techniques using **NLTK** and other libraries.  

## Features
- Sentence Tokenization  
- Word Tokenization  
- Stopword Removal  
- Stemming  
- Lemmatization

##  Why is Text Preprocessing Important?
Before feeding text into machine learning or deep learning models, it needs to be **cleaned and standardized**.  
- Removes noise from the data  
- Reduces dimensionality (e.g., “processing” and “processed” → “process”)  
- Improves accuracy of NLP models (sentiment analysis, chatbots, classification, etc.)
